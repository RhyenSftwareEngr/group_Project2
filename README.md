• The result should show the formats of a Matrix • Addition and subtraction on two matrices can be done if Matrix A and Matrix B are of the same size/dimension.
If the condition is not satisfied, display a message. 

• Illustrations: Consider the two matrices A &amp; B of size 2 x 2. Then the sum is given by: ������ � = * 1 3 2 4 / ��� ������ � =
* 5 7 6 8 /,�h�� �h� ��� (� + �) �� * 6 10 8 12/  
Also, for two matrices of the same size, the difference is given by: ������ � = * 9 6 8 7 / ��� ������ � = * 5 7 6 8 /,�h�� �h� ���������� 
(� − �) �� * 4 −1 2 −1 / • For multiplication, the number of columns in the first matrix should be equal to the number of rows in the second matrix.
If the condition is not satisfied, display a message. • 

Illustration: Assume that Matrix A = E  2 1 3 3 −2 1 −1 0 1  F and Matrix B = E 1 −2 2 1 4 −2 F then A*B = E 16 −12 3 −10 3 0 F  
Note A*B is not equal B*A. • The transpose of a matrix is found by interchanging its rows into columns or columns into rows. • 

Illustration: Matrix A = E 2 1 3 3 5 7 4 0 2 F. �h� ��������� �� ������ � �� E 2 3 4 1 5 0 3 7 2 F.  • 

The Determinant of a Matrix is a real number that can be defined for square matrices only i.e, the number of rows and columns of the matrices must be equal. 

If the condition is not satisfied, display a message. • Consider matrix A = * 4 3 2 5 /  • The determinant of matrix A is (4*5) - (3*2) = 14. •
